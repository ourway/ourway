### Hi there 👋

I've been designing and building distributed systems for more years than I probably care to mention. However, since it is also [so much fun](https://farshid.co.uk) I'll probably keep on doing this onward - until they'll pry the keyboard out of my cold dead hands or something to that effect. :).

I was head of Python engineering at [Revolut Ltd](https://revolut.com) and currently, I am now leading ICB's data engineering department at [J.P. Morgan and Chase Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com).

```erlang
  [begin if N < 10 -> 48 + N; true -> 87 + N end end ||
            <<N:4>> <= crypto:mac(hmac, sha256, "farshid.ashouri", "@gmail.com")].
```
