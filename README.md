### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been designing and building distributed systems for more years than I probably care to mention. However, since it is also so much fun I'll probably keep on doing this onward - until they'll pry the keyboard out of my cold dead hands or something to that effect. :).
Currently I am a lead software engineer at [Revolut Ltd](https://revollut.com).
